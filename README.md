# **Happy _buidling_!**

This repository contains some sample project that you can use as the starting point
for your Ethereum project. It's also a great fit for learning the basics of
smart contract development.

This project is intended to be used with the
[Hardhat Beginners Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial), but you should be
able to follow it by yourself by reading the README and exploring its
`contracts`, `tests`, `scripts` and `frontend` directories.

## Quick start

The first things you need to installing its
dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
# deploy uniswap contracts to local blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/2_deploy_uniswap.js --network localhost
```

----

## TODO:
Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: There's [an issue in `ganache-core`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/650) that can make the `npm install` step fail. 
>
> If you see `npm ERR! code ENOLOCAL`, try running `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.
